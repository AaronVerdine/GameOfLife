# GameOfLife

For the first Build Week in the Compute Science module, we'll implement Cellular Autmata and Conway's "Game of Life"

# Turing Completeness

- the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine
- A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers
- nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored

# Turing Machine

- is a mathematical model of computation tht defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules

# Rules of the Game

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead
